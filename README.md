# Logistic Regression

This repository is for Python code implementing algorithms for logistic regression using Numpy and Pandas based on the course [Deep Learning Prerequisites: Logistic Regression in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-logistic-regression-in-python/).

The code for the course can be found here:

- <https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples/tree/master/ann_logistic_extra> - contains the E-commerce data "ecommerce_data.csv"
- <https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples/tree/master/logistic_regression_class>

The sigmoid function was implemented to avoid overflow errors.  A discussion about this can be found here:
